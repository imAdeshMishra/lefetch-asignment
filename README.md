# Packages Used

| Package      | Purpose                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| flutter_bloc | State management             |

# Project Architecture

The project follows **Clean Architecture** with three layers:

```
lib
 ├── core
 │   ├── constants
 │   └── resources
 │
 ├── features
 │   └── users_list
 │       ├── data
 │       │   ├── data_sources
 │       │   ├── models
 │       │   └── repository
 │       │
 │       ├── domain
 │       │   ├── entities
 │       │   ├── repository
 │       │   └── usecases
 │       │
 │       └── presentation
 │           ├── bloc
 │           └── pages
```

This separation improves **scalability, testability, and maintainability**.

# User Detail Screen

When a user is tapped, the detail page displays:

- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Website
- Company Name
- Address (City)

---

# Assumptions Made

- The API response structure will remain consistent.
- Internet connectivity is available when fetching users.
- Only basic error handling is implemented for network failures.
- User search is performed locally on the fetched list.
